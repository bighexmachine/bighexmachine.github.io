<h1>The Big Hex Machine</h1>

<p>The <a href = "photo.html">'Big Hex Machine'</a> is a giant, yet simple, 16-bit computer specifically designed to explain
  how a computer works. Its instruction set requires a very small compiler, but it is powerful
  enough to implement useful programs.</p>

<p> The giant machine, based in the Merchant Venturers School of Engineering, measures over eight square meters. It is built out of over 100 specially
  designed four-bit circuit boards, which enables students to be taught about fundamental principles of computer architecture from
just a few basic components.</p>

<p>It was designed, and built, by students and staff at the University of Bristol's Computer Science Department.</p>
